The challenge:
                You have 2 seconds to parse the word.
                Send the answer back using https://ringzer0ctf.com/challenges/17/[your_string]

                An image is shown with white letters on a mixed background

The writeup:
                First I thought, it might not be an OCR challenge.
                We have a payload in base64, maybe we can check the content and find what makes the white text.
                Otherwise this is an OCR challenge and we can use easyOCR or pytessaract.

                After comparing the bytes of the two images, there is too much difference between the two. 
                So this is a OCR challenge after all.

                Between pytessaract and easyOCR, I suggest using easyOCR. The installation process is a lot simpler.
                And reading other Writeup my interpretation is correct.

                Only detail to consider is to download 2 recognition models by running this command:
                
                ' reader = easyocr.Reader(['en','fr'], recog_network = 'latin_g1', gpu = False) '
                
                BEFORE you query the page for the challenge.

                Then for the rest we don't need to preprocess the image at all, we just decode the base 64 and feed the raw byte to easyOCR
                and VOILÃ€!

                We need between 1 and 5 tries to get the flag, not bad at all!
